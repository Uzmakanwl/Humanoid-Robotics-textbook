# Create NVIDIA Isaac Spec

## PROMPT_TEXT

Module 3 – The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Purpose:
Introduce advanced perception, navigation, and training for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac.

Audience:
AI/software engineering students in Physical AI and robotics.

Chapters (Docusaurus .md):

1. NVIDIA Isaac Fundamentals
- What NVIDIA Isaac is
- Role in AI-driven robotics
- Isaac Sim vs Isaac ROS

2. Perception & Localization with Isaac ROS
- Visual SLAM (VSLAM) concepts
- Hardware-accelerated perception
- Sensor data flow for navigation

3. Navigation & Training for Humanoids
- Nav2 overview and path planning
- Bipedal humanoid navigation concepts
- Simulation-to-real workflow

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully created the specification for Module 3 - The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™). The specification includes:

- Comprehensive feature overview with purpose and target audience
- Detailed user scenarios for students, educators, and practitioners
- Functional requirements covering all three chapters (NVIDIA Isaac Fundamentals, Perception & Localization with Isaac ROS, Navigation & Training for Humanoids)
- Non-functional requirements for performance, usability, and reliability
- Measurable success criteria for learning outcomes and educational effectiveness
- Key entities and concepts related to NVIDIA Isaac
- Assumptions and dependencies

The specification was validated with a quality checklist confirming all requirements are met, no implementation details are present, and all acceptance criteria are clearly defined. The spec is ready for the planning phase.
