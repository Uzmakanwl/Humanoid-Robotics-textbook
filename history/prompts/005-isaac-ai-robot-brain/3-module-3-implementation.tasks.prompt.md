# Prompt History Record: Module 3 Implementation

## Prompt Text

```
sp.implement
```

## Response Summary

Successfully executed the implementation workflow for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™). The following tasks were completed and marked as completed in tasks.md:

- T025: Test all navigation links and internal references - Verified by successful Docusaurus build
- T026: Validate code examples and practical exercises - Fixed typo in quickstart.md (nvidia-isaa-ros2 → nvidia-isaac-ros2)
- T027: Update quickstart guide with complete learning path - Verified existing comprehensive guide
- T028: Update footer links in docusaurus.config.ts to include Module 3 - Confirmed already completed
- T033: Cross-reference validation - Verified internal links work correctly
- T034: Build process validation - Verified successful Docusaurus build

The implementation process confirmed that most of the content creation tasks for Module 3 were already completed, with only review, validation, and quality assurance tasks remaining. The documentation builds successfully with no broken links, and all cross-references are valid. The project infrastructure is properly set up with appropriate ignore files for the Docusaurus-based documentation site.
