# Digital Twin Module Planning

## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

Set up Module -2 in docusaurus with structure chapters for Gazebo & unity simulation (physics ,enviroument,sensors). -all content written as.md file,organized per chapter for easy navigation

## Response

Created comprehensive implementation plan for the Digital Twin Simulation Module (Module 2) in the ROS 2 Educational Module:

1. Created implementation plan at `specs/004-digital-twin-simulation/plan.md`
2. Created research document at `specs/004-digital-twin-simulation/research.md`
3. Created quickstart guide at `specs/004-digital-twin-simulation/quickstart.md`
4. Organized the plan with clear phases:
   - Phase 0: Research & Analysis
   - Phase 1: Design & Architecture
   - Phase 2: Implementation Plan
   - Phase 3: Deployment & Validation

The plan includes detailed content structure for:
- Introduction to Digital Twins
- Gazebo Fundamentals
- Physics Simulation (gravity, collisions, dynamics)
- Environment Modeling (indoor, outdoor, interactive objects)
- Sensor Simulation (cameras, LIDAR, IMU, force/torque)
- Unity Integration (visualization, interfaces)
- Combined Workflows

The plan follows Docusaurus standards with content organized in markdown files per chapter for easy navigation, specifically addressing Gazebo & Unity simulation with focus on physics, environment, and sensors as requested.

## Outcome

Successfully created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Digital Twin Simulation Module with detailed structure for Gazebo and Unity simulation content, organized in .md files per chapter for easy navigation.
