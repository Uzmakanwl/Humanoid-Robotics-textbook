# Digital Twin Module Tasks

## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

sp.tasks

## Response

Created comprehensive task list for the Digital Twin Simulation Module implementation at `specs/004-digital-twin-simulation/tasks.md`.

The tasks are organized in phases following the user story priorities:
- Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
- Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T007)
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Digital Twin Fundamentals (T008-T016) - Priority P1
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Physics Simulation with Gazebo (T017-T028) - Priority P2
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - High-Fidelity Unity Interaction (T029-T038) - Priority P3
- Phase 6: Environment Modeling (T039-T046)
- Phase 7: Sensor Simulation (T047-T055)
- Phase 8: Combined Workflows (T056-T062)
- Phase 9: Quality Assurance & Validation (T063-T074)
- Phase 10: Deployment & Validation (T075-T089)

Total of 89 tasks created with proper checklist format including:
- Sequential task IDs (T001 to T089)
- User story labels ([US1], [US2], [US3]) for relevant tasks
- Parallel execution markers ([P]) for tasks that can run in parallel
- Specific file paths for each task
- Clear implementation steps organized by user story priority

The tasks cover all aspects of the Digital Twin module including Gazebo physics simulation, Unity integration, environment modeling, sensor simulation, and combined workflows as requested.

## Outcome

Successfully created a comprehensive task list with 89 specific, actionable tasks organized by priority and user story for implementing the Digital Twin Simulation Module with Gazebo and Unity simulation content.
