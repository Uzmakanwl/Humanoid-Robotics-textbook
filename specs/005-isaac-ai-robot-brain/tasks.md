# Tasks: Module 3 – The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

**Feature**: Module 3 – The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
**Created**: 2025-12-26
**Status**: Draft
**Branch**: 005-isaac-ai-robot-brain

## Implementation Strategy

This implementation follows a phased approach with progressive delivery of functionality. The tasks are organized by user story priority (P1, P2, P3) to enable independent implementation and testing of each feature. The approach focuses on delivering an MVP with the first user story, then incrementally adding more advanced functionality.

## Dependencies

- Docusaurus documentation system (already installed)
- ROS 2 knowledge from Module 1
- Digital twin concepts from Module 2
- Basic robotics understanding
- Access to NVIDIA Isaac platform (for practical examples)
